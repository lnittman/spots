## Technical Implementation Details

### MapBox Integration

The MapView component creates a flexible and reusable map implementation:

```typescript
export function MapView({
  center = DEFAULT_CENTER,
  zoom = 12,
  markers = [],
  onMarkerClick,
  className,
  interactive = true,
  controls = true,
  style = 'light',
}: MapViewProps) {
  const mapContainer = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const map = useRef<mapboxgl.Map | null>(null);
  const markersRef = useRef<{ [id: string]: mapboxgl.Marker }>({});
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);

  // Style options to choose from
  const mapStyles = {
    light: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11',
    dark: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v11',
    streets: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12',
    outdoors: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v12',
    satellite: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v12',
  };

  // Initialize map on first render
  useEffect(() => {
    if (map.current || !mapContainer.current) return;
    
    // Set the access token from environment variable
    mapboxgl.accessToken = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN || '';
    
    // Create a new map
    map.current = new mapboxgl.Map({
      container: mapContainer.current,
      style: mapStyles[style],
      center,
      zoom,
      interactive,
      attributionControl: false,
    });
    
    // Add controls if requested
    if (controls) {
      map.current.addControl(new mapboxgl.NavigationControl(), 'top-right');
      map.current.addControl(
        new mapboxgl.GeolocateControl({
          positionOptions: { enableHighAccuracy: true },
          trackUserLocation: true,
        }),
        'top-right'
      );
    }
    
    // Add a scale control
    map.current.addControl(new mapboxgl.ScaleControl(), 'bottom-left');
    
    // Set loaded state when map is ready
    map.current.on('load', () => {
      setLoaded(true);
    });
    
    // Clean up on unmount
    return () => {
      if (map.current) {
        map.current.remove();
        map.current = null;
      }
    };
  }, [center, zoom, interactive, controls, style]);
}
```

### Interest Utilities and Standardization

The interest utilities enhance raw interest names with visual elements:

```typescript
export function enhanceInterest(interest: string | { id: string; name: string; emoji?: string; color?: string }) {
  if (typeof interest === 'string') {
    return {
      id: interest.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-'),
      name: interest,
      emoji: getEmojiForInterest(interest),
      color: getColorForInterest(interest)
    };
  }
  
  return {
    ...interest,
    emoji: interest.emoji || getEmojiForInterest(interest.name),
    color: interest.color || getColorForInterest(interest.name)
  };
}
```

### Mock Recommendation System

The recommendation system provides personalized spot suggestions:

```typescript
export function getRecommendedSpots(interests: string[], count: number = 5): Spot[] {
  const spotsByInterests = getSpotsByInterests(interests);
  const popular = spotsByInterests.filter(spot => spot.popular);
  const verified = spotsByInterests.filter(spot => spot.verified);
  
  // Prioritize spots that are both popular and verified
  const prioritySpots = popular.filter(spot => spot.verified);
  const remainingCount = count - prioritySpots.length;
  
  if (remainingCount <= 0) {
    // If we have enough priority spots, return a subset
    return prioritySpots.slice(0, count);
  }
  
  // Add some popular spots that aren't verified
  const popularNotVerified = popular.filter(spot => !spot.verified);
  let recommendations = [...prioritySpots];
  
  if (popularNotVerified.length > 0) {
    const popularToAdd = Math.min(remainingCount, popularNotVerified.length);
    recommendations = [...recommendations, ...popularNotVerified.slice(0, popularToAdd)];
  }
  
  // If we still need more, add verified spots that aren't popular
  if (recommendations.length < count) {
    const verifiedNotPopular = verified.filter(spot => !spot.popular);
    const verifiedToAdd = Math.min(count - recommendations.length, verifiedNotPopular.length);
    recommendations = [...recommendations, ...verifiedNotPopular.slice(0, verifiedToAdd)];
  }
  
  // If we still need more, add random spots
  if (recommendations.length < count) {
    const remaining = spotsByInterests.filter(
      spot => !recommendations.some(r => r.id === spot.id)
    );
    const randomToAdd = Math.min(count - recommendations.length, remaining.length);
    recommendations = [...recommendations, ...remaining.slice(0, randomToAdd)];
  }
  
  return recommendations;
}
```
