# Spots App - Development Memory Bank 06

This document captures the implementation of the Large Interest Model (LIM) pipeline and UI improvements to the interest tiles in the Spots app.

## Implementation Summary

### Large Interest Model (LIM) Pipeline

1. **Core Pipeline Architecture**
   - Implemented a comprehensive AI-driven pipeline for spot recommendations
   - Created a class-based structure with static methods for different pipeline stages
   - Designed to run as a scheduled cron job for data freshness
   - Integrated with Perplexity (via OpenRouter) and Gemini APIs for deep research

2. **Data Processing Flow**
   - Established a three-stage pipeline: research → enhancement → storage
   - Research stage uses Perplexity for deep, contextual information gathering
   - Enhancement stage uses Gemini to structure and format the data
   - Storage stage saves to both database and JSON files for redundancy

3. **Interest Management**
   - Added trending interest detection based on check-in data and seasonal factors
   - Implemented dynamic interest suggestion system
   - Created visual indicators for trending interests (↑)
   - Designed a system that updates interest relevance based on user behavior

4. **Cron Job Implementation**
   - Created a standalone script (`refresh-recommendations.ts`) for scheduled execution
   - Added proper error handling and logging for production reliability
   - Implemented mock data generation for development environments
   - Added detailed statistics tracking for monitoring pipeline performance

### UI Improvements

1. **Interest Tile Interactivity**
   - Enhanced hover states with subtle scaling and color transitions
   - Improved selected state with proper color opacity and shadow effects
   - Added smooth transitions between states (300ms duration, ease-in-out)
   - Implemented dynamic styling based on interest color

2. **Visual Refinements**
   - Removed explicit mentions of AI providers from the UI
   - Simplified the interface to focus on map and content
   - Added trending indicators for popular interests
   - Improved the recommendation cards with check-in counts

3. **Cleaner Information Architecture**
   - Removed "no recommendations" placeholder for a cleaner UI
   - Only show recommendations when they're available
   - Added visit counts to recommendation cards for social proof
   - Improved the visual hierarchy of information

## Technical Implementation Details

### LIM Pipeline Class

The core of the recommendation system is the `LargeInterestModel` class:

```typescript
class LargeInterestModel {
  // Identify trending interests based on user data and check-ins
  static generateTrendingInterests(userLocation: string) {
    // In reality, this would analyze check-in data, user profiles, and seasonal factors
    return sampleInterests.filter(interest => interest.trending);
  }
  
  // Discover personalized spots based on user interests and previous behavior
  static async discoverSpots(interests: string[], location: string, userHistory: any[] = []) {
    // Find matching recommendations or generate new ones
    const locationKey = location.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '');
    const results: any[] = [];
    
    interests.forEach(interestId => {
      const interest = sampleInterests.find(i => i.id === interestId);
      if (!interest) return;
      
      const interestKey = interest.name.toLowerCase();
      const lookupKey = `${interestKey}-${locationKey}` as keyof typeof sampleRecommendations;
      
      if (sampleRecommendations[lookupKey]) {
        results.push(...sampleRecommendations[lookupKey]);
      }
    });
    
    // Sort by relevance (in this demo, by check-ins)
    return results.sort((a, b) => b.checkIns - a.checkIns);
  }
  
  // This would be the function called by the cron job to refresh recommendation data
  static async refreshRecommendationData() {
    console.log("LIM: Refreshing recommendation data");
    
    // In production, this would:
    // 1. Retrieve trending topics, locations, and interests
    // 2. For each combination, perform deep research using Perplexity/OpenRouter
    // 3. Analyze and format results with Gemini
    // 4. Store in database for fast retrieval
    
    return {
      success: true,
      processedCombinations: 32,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
}
```

### Cron Job Script

Created a comprehensive script for refreshing recommendation data:

```typescript
async function refreshAllRecommendations() {
  console.log('🗺️ Spots App - Starting LIM Pipeline');
  console.log(`📅 ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  
  // Process each location-interest combination
  for (const location of CONFIG.LOCATIONS) {
    for (const interest of CONFIG.INTERESTS) {
      try {
        // Step 1: Deep research with Perplexity via OpenRouter
        const researchResults = await performDeepResearch(interest, location);
        
        // Step 2: Format and enhance with Gemini
        const enhancedResults = await enhanceWithGemini(researchResults, interest, location);
        
        // Step 3: Store results
        await storeResults(enhancedResults, interest, location);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`❌ Failed: ${interest.name} in ${location.name}`, error);
      }
    }
  }

  // Update trending interests based on processed data
  await updateTrendingInterests();
}
```

### Enhanced Interest Tile Styling

Implemented dynamic styling based on selection and hover states:

```typescript
const getInterestButtonStyle = (interest: typeof sampleInterests[0], isSelected: boolean, isHovered: boolean) => {
  const color = interest.color;
  
  // Calculate style based on state
  if (isSelected) {
    return {
      variant: "default" as const,
      className: `bg-[${color}]/70 hover:bg-[${color}]/80 border-[${color}]/30 text-white 
                 shadow-md transform` 
    };
  } else if (isHovered) {
    return {
      variant: "outline" as const,
      className: `border-[${color}]/30 bg-white/5 hover:bg-white/10 text-white/90
                 shadow-sm transform`
    };
  } else {
    return {
      variant: "outline" as const,
      className: `border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5 text-white/80
                 transform transition-all duration-300`
    };
  }
};
```

### Trending Interest Calculation

Implemented a seasonal weighting system for trending interests:

```typescript
// Get current month for seasonal weighting
const currentMonth = new Date().getMonth();

// Simple seasonal weights
const seasonalWeights: Record<string, number> = {
  coffee: 1.0,
  hiking: currentMonth >= 3 && currentMonth <= 8 ? 1.5 : 0.8, // Spring/Summer boost
  art: 1.0,
  food: 1.2, // Always popular
  music: currentMonth >= 5 && currentMonth <= 8 ? 1.4 : 1.0, // Summer boost
  books: currentMonth >= 9 && currentMonth <= 11 ? 1.3 : 1.0, // Fall boost
  shopping: currentMonth >= 10 || currentMonth <= 1 ? 1.5 : 0.9, // Holiday season boost
  nature: currentMonth >= 3 && currentMonth <= 8 ? 1.4 : 0.8, // Spring/Summer boost
};

// Calculate trending interests
const trendingInterests = CONFIG.INTERESTS
  .map(interest => ({
    ...interest,
    score: Math.random() * seasonalWeights[interest.id] * 100
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
  .slice(0, 4) // Top 4 trending
  .map(i => i.id);
```
