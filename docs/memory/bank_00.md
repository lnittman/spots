# Spots App - Development Memory Bank 00

This document serves as the first in a series of memory banks for the Spots application development, capturing key decisions, implementation notes, and next steps.

## Current Status

- Project structure and documentation framework established
- Initial design decisions and technical architecture defined
- Core functionality and feature requirements outlined

## Recent Updates

### Design Implementation

- Successfully implemented styles in the app
- Decision to use map emoji (üó∫Ô∏è) as the app logo
- Font selection: Iosevka font for a clean, utilitarian aesthetic
  ```css
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'IosevkaTerm-Regular';
    src: url('https://intdev-global.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/internet-dev/6397be61-3ea4-459d-8a3e-fd95168cb214.woff2') format('woff2');
  }
  ```

### Home Page Enhancement

The home page will be redesigned with the following principles:
- Simple, effective, utilitarian design
- Interactive, functional demo over static content
- Live map integration for location selection
- Trending/suggested interests selection
- Demonstration of the app's recommendation capabilities
- Pre-computed AI-powered content (via cron jobs) to avoid real-time LLM calls for every visitor

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Font Integration**
   - Implement Iosevka font throughout the application
   - Add font-face declaration to global CSS
   - Apply font-family to text elements

2. **Logo Implementation**
   - Add map emoji (üó∫Ô∏è) as the app logo in header/favicon
   - Create consistent logo styling

3. **Interactive Home Page**
   - Develop map component for location selection
   - Create interest selection UI with trending suggestions
   - Implement pre-computed recommendation showcase
   - Build connection to recommendation pipeline

### Development Roadmap

Following the implementation strategy from [init.md](/docs/init.md):

1. **Complete Foundation Setup**
   - Finalize project scaffolding
   - Set up core infrastructure
   - Establish AI pipeline foundation

2. **Core Features Implementation**
   - Build interest selection system
   - Develop recommendation engine
   - Complete user interface development

3. **Advanced Features & Refinement**
   - Integrate maps functionality
   - Enhance recommendation capabilities
   - Performance optimization and polish

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Font Implementation

The Iosevka font will be applied through Tailwind by:
1. Adding the font-face declaration to `globals.css`
2. Extending the Tailwind theme with the custom font
3. Applying the font-family class to container elements

### Interactive Home Page

The home page demo will be implemented with:
1. React components for map and interest selection
2. Pre-computed AI recommendations stored in a database
3. Client-side interactivity without heavy server load
4. Progressive enhancement for improved performance

### Pre-computed AI Content

To avoid real-time LLM interactions for every visitor:
1. Create scheduled jobs to generate fresh recommendations
2. Store recommendations in database with location and interest tags
3. Implement fast retrieval for demo showcase
4. Update content regularly to maintain relevance

## Open Questions

- What is the refresh cadence for pre-computed AI recommendations?
- Should we implement user accounts for the initial MVP or focus on anonymous experience?
- What metrics should we track to measure home page effectiveness?
