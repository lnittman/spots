## Technical Implementation Details

### Map Integration

The map integration was achieved with Mapbox GL JS:

```typescript
mapboxgl.accessToken = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN || 'pk.placeholder_token';

// Inside component:
useEffect(() => {
  if (!mapContainerRef.current) return;
  
  const mapInstance = new mapboxgl.Map({
    container: mapContainerRef.current,
    style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12',
    center,
    zoom,
    interactive,
  });
  
  // Add controls
  mapInstance.addControl(new mapboxgl.NavigationControl(), 'top-right');
  mapInstance.addControl(new mapboxgl.GeolocateControl({
    positionOptions: { enableHighAccuracy: true },
    trackUserLocation: true
  }));
  
  setMap(mapInstance);
  
  return () => {
    mapInstance.remove();
  };
}, []);
```

### Pre-computed Recommendation System

To avoid real-time LLM calls for every visitor, we implemented a demo system using pre-computed recommendations:

```typescript
// Sample recommendations lookup by interest and location
const sampleRecommendations = {
  'coffee-sf': [
    {
      id: 'c1',
      name: 'Ritual Coffee Roasters',
      description: 'Specialty coffee shop with single-origin beans and minimalist decor.',
      // ...other details
    },
    // ...more recommendations
  ],
  // ...other interest-location combinations
};

// Recommendation lookup based on user selections
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedLocation && selectedInterests.length > 0) {
    const locationKey = selectedLocation.title.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '');
    const interestKey = sampleInterests.find(i => i.id === selectedInterests[0])?.name.toLowerCase() || '';
    const lookupKey = `${interestKey}-${locationKey}` as keyof typeof sampleRecommendations;
    
    // Check if we have recommendations for this combination
    if (sampleRecommendations[lookupKey]) {
      setRecommendations(sampleRecommendations[lookupKey]);
    } else {
      setRecommendations([]);
    }
  } else {
    setRecommendations([]);
  }
}, [selectedLocation, selectedInterests]);
```

### Mobile-First Design

Applied a mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive classes:

```html
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  <div className="md:col-span-2">
    <!-- Map component with responsive height -->
    <MapView 
      className="h-[400px] md:h-[500px]" 
      // ...other props
    />
  </div>
  
  <!-- Interest selection, responsive grid -->
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <!-- Interest buttons -->
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Responsive recommendation grid -->
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <!-- Recommendation cards -->
</div>
```

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Intuitive Interaction Flow**
   - Clearly labeled map and interest selection
   - Immediate visual feedback when selecting locations or interests
   - Recommendations appear only when both location and interest are selected

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Map given prominence with larger size
   - Clear section headings
   - Card-based UI for distinct content areas
   - Consistent use of spacing and typography

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Map instantiation with error handling
   - Marker creation optimized with try/catch blocks
   - Pre-computed data to avoid API calls for demo purposes

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to Real Data Sources**
   - Implement API endpoints for recommendation retrieval
   - Replace sample data with real database-backed content
   - Add caching strategy for frequently requested combinations

2. **Enhance Map Functionality**
   - Add clustering for markers with many locations
   - Implement custom map styles aligned with brand
   - Improve marker interaction on mobile devices

3. **Improve Recommendation Quality**
   - Build data pipeline for computing recommendations
   - Create automated system for refreshing recommendations
   - Implement feedback mechanism for recommendation quality

4. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user accounts for saving preferences
   - Track favorite locations
   - Personalize recommendations based on user history

5. **Progressive Web App Features**
   - Implement offline capability
   - Add install prompt
   - Configure service worker for caching

## Open Questions

- What is the optimal refresh frequency for pre-computed recommendations?
- How can we gather location data at scale for various cities?
- What analytics should we track to measure engagement with the interactive map?
- Should we implement user accounts for the initial MVP, or focus on anonymous experience first?

## Lessons Learned

1. **MapboxGL Integration**
   - Error handling is critical for map instantiation
   - Proper cleanup is essential in the useEffect return function
   - Marker management requires careful reference tracking

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Grid layouts provide flexible responsive behavior
   - Mobile-first approach simplifies progressive enhancement
   - Card components need special attention for spacing on mobile

3. **UI Component Architecture**
   - Reusable card and badge components improve consistency
   - Extracting map functionality into separate components improves maintainability
   - Consistent props patterns make components more intuitive to use
